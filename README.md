HelloQueueDemo
==============

A demo for CohhCarnage!

Hey Cohh!

I made this demo in a day because my new years is utterly lackluster! I'm watching your stream right now and
finished up my little demo of my own version of the hello queue. I'd love feedback, but keep in mind I only
spent a day on it so I'm sure it's got some issues in places ;) Once again, if you want more or would like
me to add/take away things for more demo goodness, please let me know. For a look at my web development, 
you can go to my website at http://www.rittertech.com. Thanks a lot Cohh!

Sincerely,

Matthew Ritter
